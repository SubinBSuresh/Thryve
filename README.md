decent fitness apps for tracking daily calorie intake come with a cost, so decided to build one for personal purposes. Putting that android dev energy into a little side project which will save up some pennies as well as a give a learning experience on new topics.

Also thought of adding a Personal record of the weights lifted so that i could make a calculated move on the next workout.

Whenever i get some time (and motivation), will try to complete it.
